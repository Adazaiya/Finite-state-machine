# Finite-state-machine

We are evaluating a simple finite state machine to implement our eventual output
where we are generating a C code which receives an integer from the user from reading a
text file and we then print the word from the specified line. The finite state machine here
represents the stages throughout the whole process from reading the text to reaching the
desired integer number of the line to finally retrieving the word.
